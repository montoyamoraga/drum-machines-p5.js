## About

drum-machines-p5.js is a project by [aar√≥n montoya-moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/).

drum-machines-p5.js is a celebration and combination of two of my passions:

* [drum machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine), electronic instruments to program and create rhytmic sounds.
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a software library and community for creative coding.

drum-machines-p5.js is a project started in late 2019, and is done iteratively and slowly.

## Drum machines

These are the current drum machines being studied:

* [Roland CR-78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_CR-78)
* [Roland TR-808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808)
* [Roland TR-909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-909)

## Live versions

These are the links for the online versions included on this repository so far:

* [Roland TR-808](./roland-tr-808)


## Constraints

* The code should be as documented as possible
* Readability over elegance
* Recycle

## Design notes

* The design of the GUI should be parameterized.
* Relative values over absolute values

## Technical notes

This project uses p5.js v1.0.0, and is a collection of recreations of drum machines

## Sound design notes

* Use easy to understand sound sources
* Synthesis over sampling
